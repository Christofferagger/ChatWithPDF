## Switch OpenAI model
If you want to use another OpenAI model, head to server.js in the server folder. Then find the modelName property in the model variable. Here you can change your model to whatever you prefer! 
Here is the code you should look for. 
```
const model = new ChatOpenAI({ 
            modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
            ...
```
